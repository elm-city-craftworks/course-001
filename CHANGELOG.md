### 2014.04.20

* Reorganize `solutions` branch, clean up README.md a little bit 
in `master` branch.

### 2014.04.19

* Course materials for Part 2 released!

### 2014.04.08

* Added an extra `ls` use case in PART_1.md, covering basic `ls somedir` usage.
This complicates implementation somewhat, but is an important feature even
for a minimal clone.

### 2014.04.07

* Added a clarification in PART_1.md about how `ls` works differently depending on whether it
is outputting directly to the console or being run in a 
subshell / command pipeline. For the purpose of the exercise, we'll focus on the
latter because our acceptance tests run `ls` in a subshell, and because the
machine readable output is easier to implement.

* Added CHANGELOG.md

### 2014.04.03

* Course materials for Part 1 released!
* Fix minor issue with mislabeled commands in Part 1 tests
