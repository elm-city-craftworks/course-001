some questions to test your understanding, and some project-based exercises
to put the concepts into practice.

* Standard I/O streams and the filesystem ([Instructions][PART_1.md], [Solutions][PART_1_SOLUTIONS])

* Encoding and decoding binary files ([Instructions][PART_2.md], [Solutions][PART_2_SOLUTIONS])

* Parsing text-based formats ([Instructions][PART_3.md], [Solutions][PART_3_SOLUTIONS])

* Socket programming and Network I/O ([Instructions][PART_4.md], [Solutions][PART_4_SOLUTIONS])

### News and Updates

adding your answers inline, and then adding that file to your repository.

* For questions or general guidance with the assignments, open a ticket or 
comment on a ticket that is already open. See closed tickets marked 
"solved" to see if your problem has already been discussed.
