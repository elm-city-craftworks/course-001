## Part 3: Parsing text-based file formats

The article we'll work through in this part of the 
course is [Parsing JSON the hard way](https://practicingruby.com/articles/parsing-json-the-hard-way).
Reading it carefully should prepare you to work through the questions
and exercises for this topic.

We still have not released the practice materials for this part of the course
yet, but you are welcome to get a head start on the reading, or work on
the parts of the course that have already been released (see the README
in the project root for details)
